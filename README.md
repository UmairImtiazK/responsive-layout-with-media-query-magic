# React + Vite

This Responsive Landing Page, designed and developed with vanilla CSS and best frontend practices, offers a clean and engaging layout optimized for all devices. Following guidance from YouTuber Kevin Powell, I crafted custom CSS classes and styling techniques to create a fully responsive page. The design, initially conceptualized in Figma, was translated into a highly organized and scalable codebase. This project showcases modern CSS techniques, including media queries and custom styling, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
